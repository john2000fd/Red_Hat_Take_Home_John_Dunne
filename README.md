# Red_Hat_Take_Home_John_Dunne
My solution for the 042234 continuous release automation take home for Red Hat.

This solution was written in Python using version 3.11.9 on Visual Studio Code (VSC) version 1.96.4

To run this program, make sure that you have installed Python 3.11.9 in your VSC environment, as well as the 'requests' module which is external.
To do this, run this command in VSC's terminal:
```
pip install requests
```

Once this is completed, you can run the program by clicking 'Run' -> 'Run Without Debugging' which is situated on the top UI bar of VSC.
The solution will appear in the built in terminal.
